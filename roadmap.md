# 🗺️ Praximous Development Roadmap

MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // BUILD // RITUAL // REPEAT

Welcome to the unfolding evolution of [jamesthegiblet.co.uk](https://jamesthegiblet.co.uk) — a living vault of robotic builds, modular tools, cinematic lore, and sovereign design rituals.

Each phase below represents a build chapter. Execution is chat-driven. Deployment is modular. Documentation is continuous.

---

## 🛸 PHASE I – INITIATE CORE INTERFACE

🎯 Goal: Establish the CLI-style dashboard homepage and thematic backbone.

- [x] Deploy `index.html` with CRT styling and glyph footer toggle
- [x] Apply `praximous_terminal.css` with full neon + spiral theme
- [x] Embed spiral sigil logo with pulsing animation and typewriter header
- [x] Create `README.md` manifest and link in live repo
- [ ] Add stealth Easter Egg glyph → trigger `hack.html`

---

## 🔧 PHASE II – SUMMON MODULES & CONTENT ZONES

🎯 Goal: Create core content zones to house your 3D models, project logs, and product offerings.

- [ ] Build `artifacts.html` with Three.js 3D viewer for STL/GLB models
- [ ] Embed Cults3D artifact links + lore descriptions
- [ ] Drop `projects.html` with GitHub repo browser (auto README fetch)
- [ ] Style GitHub modules as terminal cards
- [ ] Draft `summon.html` with subscription tiers (Adept, Initiate, Mythwright)
- [ ] Add QR glyph logic for physical packaging → Vault access

---

## 📖 PHASE III – DOCUMENTATION & RITUALIZATION

🎯 Goal: Codify your builder rituals, authorship logic, and modular protocols.

- [ ] Create `codex.html` with rulebook sections + design philosophies
- [ ] Include golden ratio layout tips, modular naming rituals, EmbedID logic
- [ ] Build `vault.html` with authorship verification and QR triggers
- [ ] Add auto-documenting logic: `README.md` + `roadmap.md` per GitHub repo
- [ ] Drop glyph headers + scroll styling across docs

---

## 🎭 PHASE IV – EASTER EGG HACK PANEL

🎯 Goal: Build `hack.html` — a secret access console for hidden content.

- [ ] Hide blinking glyph in corner with delayed appearance
- [ ] On click, load terminal UI with glitch text, override logic
- [ ] Create logic puzzle or keystroke sequence to unlock scrolls
- [ ] Gate unreleased prototypes, Copilot logs, and dev fragments
- [ ] Add ambient audio FX + terminal glow toggles

---

## 📦 PHASE V – TOOLING & THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION

🎯 Goal: Introduce dev tools, upgrade modules, and API integrations.

- [ ] Add CLI-based tools showcase in `toolbelt.html`
- [ ] Enable Discord webhook or repo commits from interface
- [ ] Integrate Cults3D upload tool or product manager script
- [ ] Create modular scripts repo → link from portal
- [ ] Refactor `.env` structure to support multi-service

---

## 🌐 PHASE VI – CROSS-PLATFORM HARMONIZATION

🎯 Goal: Unify branding and lore across GitHub, Cults3D, product pages, and content channels.

- [ ] Apply spiral branding to Cults3D thumbnails
- [ ] Create QR-linked videos or lore scroll intros for each artifact
- [ ] Develop CLI intro for YouTube content
- [ ] Style Instagram posts with mythic grid and glyph scroll format
- [ ] Publish `branding_codex.md` — your visual manifesto

---

## 🧱 STRUCTURE EXPANSIONS & LORE DROPS

📦 Content Planned:

- [ ] IMSAI WOPR simulator (screen-accurate shell + lighting + voice)
- [ ] Codex Fragment: “Chronicles of the Premature Maker”
- [ ] Prototype Vault: artifacts before their time
- [ ] Mythic OS mockup: PraximOS interface via terminal or web
- [ ] 3D Printer mods + repair logs (interactive guides)

---

## 🤝 Contributor Protocol (Coming Soon)

- [ ] Open Issue Ritual System (`.rituals/` folder?)
- [ ] Contributor scroll with lineage and lore of each contributor
- [ ] Modular build challenges + glyph-based bounty tracker
