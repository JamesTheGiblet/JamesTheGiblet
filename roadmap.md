# 🗺️ Praximous Development Roadmap

MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // BUILD // RITUAL // REPEAT

Welcome to the unfolding evolution of jamesthegiblet.co.uk — a living vault of robotic builds, modular tools, cinematic lore, and sovereign design rituals.

This document serves as the master codex for the development of the main portal, detailing each build phase as a chapter in its ritualized creation. Execution is chat-driven. Deployment is modular. Documentation is continuous.
🛸 PHASE I – INITIATE CORE INTERFACE

🎯 Goal: Establish the CLI-style dashboard homepage and thematic backbone for a static website.

    [ ] Deploy index.html with CRT styling and a glyph footer toggle.

    [ ] Apply praximous_terminal.css with the full neon + spiral theme.

    [ ] Embed the spiral sigil logo with pulsing animation and a typewriter header.

    [ ] Create README.md manifest and link it in the live repository.

    [ ] Add a stealth Easter Egg glyph to trigger hack.html.

🔧 PHASE II – SUMMON MODULES & CONTENT ZONES

🎯 Goal: Create core content zones to house your 3D models, project logs, and product offerings.

    [ ] Embed the "Artifacts" and "Fabrication Glyphs" sections on the homepage with dynamic product listings powered by the Cults3D API.

    [ ] Integrate purchase links that redirect to your Cults3D storefront.

    [ ] Drop projects.html with a GitHub repo browser (auto README fetch).

    [ ] Style GitHub modules as terminal cards.

    [ ] Add QR glyph logic for physical packaging to provide a link to the website.

📖 PHASE III – DOCUMENTATION & RITUALIZATION

🎯 Goal: Codify your builder rituals and establish the purchase paths for your technical documentation.

    [ ] Create codex.html with a preview and a purchase link to a premium "Codex Fragments" page on Patreon.

    [ ] Build vault.html with authorship verification and a preview of the EmbedID project, including a purchase link to Patreon.

    [ ] Draft a preview of the roadmap.md with a purchase link for the full Roadmap & Walkthroughs on Patreon.

    [ ] Add glyph headers and scroll styling across all documentation pages.

🎭 PHASE IV – EASTER EGG HACK PANEL

🎯 Goal: Build hack.html — a secret access console for hidden content.

    [ ] Hide a blinking glyph in the corner with a delayed appearance.

    [ ] On click, load a terminal UI with glitch text and override logic.

    [ ] Create a logic puzzle or keystroke sequence to unlock hidden lore scrolls.

    [ ] Gate unreleased prototypes, Copilot logs, and dev fragments.

    [ ] Add ambient audio FX + terminal glow toggles.

📦 PHASE V – TOOLING & THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION

🎯 Goal: Introduce links to your tools and integrate external storefronts.

    [ ] Add a CLI-based tools showcase in toolbelt.html.

    [x] Create a serverless function to securely interact with the Cults3D API and expose product data.

    [x] Create a serverless function to securely interact with the Patreon API to manage premium content links.

    [x] Embed Gumroad widgets or direct links for roadmap purchases.

    [x] Ensure Cults3D links are functional for 3D model sales.

    [x] Create a modular scripts repo and link it from the portal.

    [x] Refactor .env structure to support multi-service integrations in the future.

🌐 PHASE VI – CROSS-PLATFORM HARMONIZATION

🎯 Goal: Unify branding and lore across GitHub, Cults3D, product pages, and content channels.

    [ ] Apply spiral branding to Cults3D thumbnails.

    [ ] Create QR-linked videos or lore scroll intros for each artifact.

    [ ] Develop a CLI intro for YouTube content.

    [ ] Style Instagram posts with a mythic grid and glyph scroll format.

    [ ] Publish branding_codex.md — your visual manifesto.

🧱 STRUCTURE EXPANSIONS & LORE DROPS

📦 Content Planned:

    [ ] IMSAI WOPR simulator (screen-accurate shell + lighting + voice).

    [ ] Codex Fragment: “Chronicles of the Premature Maker.”

    [ ] Prototype Vault: artifacts before their time.

    [ ] Mythic OS mockup: PraximOS interface via terminal or web.

    [ ] 3D Printer mods + repair logs (interactive guides).

🤝 Contributor Protocol (Coming Soon)

    [ ] Open Issue Ritual System (.rituals/ folder?).

    [ ] A contributor scroll with the lineage and lore of each contributor.

    [ ] Modular build challenges + a glyph-based bounty tracker.
