## James "The Giblet" Mavric: The Workshop

> Welcome to the workshop. This is where chaotic ideas are forged into open-source blueprints and professional-grade tools.

I build in public. The repos here are the transparent record of that work‚Äîthe architectural plans, the core engines, and the functional code. The real product isn't just the code; it's the repeatable, understandable system.

I give away the foundation. The blueprint is free, so you can build it yourself. The professional tool is for sale, so you can get the job done faster. üó∫Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüöÄ

### Products & Services: How This Workshop Sustains Itself üí∞

My model is built on providing value at every level, from free knowledge to finished products.

1.  **Open-Source Blueprints (Free on GitHub):** Every project starts here. You get the core logic, the architectural `README`, and a functional MVP. The knowledge is always free. Fork it, learn from it, build on it.
2.  **Professional Tools (Commercial):** For developers and teams who need reliable, polished tools that just work. These are the fully-supported, feature-rich versions built upon the open-source cores. No assembly required. *(Link to your future product page/store here)*
3.  **3D Models & Assets (√Ä La Carte on Cults3D):** For projects with physical components, you can buy the high-quality 3D models and digital assets directly. No subscription needed.
4.  **Consulting & Partnerships (Hire Me):** Need a technical collaborator to bring your vision to life? I'm available for direct consulting engagements and select partnership opportunities.

### Core Philosophy: The Mavric Way üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Permission is a Myth:** You already have it. Stop waiting and start building.
-   **Ship Blueprints at 80%:** "Perfect" is the enemy of "done." I release open-source foundations early to invite collaboration. **Professional tools ship when they're 100% ready.** Reliability is the feature.
-   **The Code is the Proof:** Credentials don't matter. Working systems do.
-   **Trust the Itch:** Intuition is just pattern recognition at speed. Your gut knows things a spreadsheet can't tell you.
-   **Brutal Honesty:** Markets don't care about your effort, only your results. Your code should be just as direct. If it's complex, it's wrong.

### üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack (Whatever Works)

-   **Languages**: Python for speed of thought, Rust for speed of execution, JavaScript for the pretty parts, C++ for hardware whispers.
-   **Data**: PostgreSQL for serious relationships, Redis for fleeting ones, SQLite for prototypes that might grow up.
-   **Infrastructure**: Strong, flexible, and never married to one expensive brand.

### ü§ù Let's Build Something

A good pull request is the best way to say "hello," but here are other ways to start:

-   **For Builders:** Fork a blueprint and make it your own.
-   **For Users:** Check out the professional tools and resources.
-   **For Visionaries:** Bring me your problem. Let's build the solution together.

*(**A Note on Boundaries**: My open-source work is free. My time and expertise are not. If you want to pick my brain, that's what a consulting gig is for.)*
