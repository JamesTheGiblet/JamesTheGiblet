# 🧠 James The Giblet | Mythic Builder Portal

**MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL**

Welcome to the modular vault of James The Giblet — polymath, caretaker, and mythwright. This GitHub portal serves as a living archive of my robotic artifacts, AI-powered systems, and ritualized engineering practices, representing a journey from interactive software to physical creations. Here, each repository is a project, a scroll, or a living codex.

### 🔮 The Invocation

This portal is a retro-terminal themed sigil, blending my creative works with a cohesive brand identity:

  * Advanced AI, robotics & 3D fabrication glyphs.
  * A living codex of mythic engineering rituals, embodied in each project's README.
  * Lore scrolls & prophetic design archives.
  * CLI-style UI with glyph logic and hidden panels.

-----

### 🛠️ The Ritual Stack

The site's architecture is built upon a foundation of powerful glyphs:

  * **HTML/CSS** (CRT + neon styling)
  * **Three.js** for the 3D artifact viewer.
  * **GitHub API** for the repository browser.
  * **QR logic** for linking to physical artifacts.
  * **ESP32 + Pi integrations** (hardware modules).
  * **OpenAI TTS** for Joshua voice synthesis.

### 🧙 Featured Artifacts

  * 🧬 **Praxis: The Living Codex**: An experimental, self-evolving AI presence designed with a bio-driven backend.
  * 🤖 **Project G.I.S.M.O.**: A mobile robot showcasing Python-based robotics, dead reckoning, and adaptive navigation.
  * 🛠️ **TotalControl**: An AI-powered GCode invocation engine for precision 3D fabrication.
  * 📝 **EmbedID**: A cryptographic tool to embed ownership sigils into source code, verifying creative lineage.
  * 🎨 **Random-Art**: A Python-powered exploration of generative art, creating unique, algorithmically driven designs.
