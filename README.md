## **James "The Giblet" Mavric: The Workshop**

> My repos are my resume, typos and all.

This isn't a portfolio of polished code. This is a public workshop where chaotic ideas are turned into functional blueprints. I ship comprehensive `READMEs`, not just code, because the real work is in the plan.

I'm giving the plan away. The code is the goal, but the blueprint is the start. üó∫Ô∏è

### **The Business Model: Here's How I Make a Living** üí∞

I don't sell finished products; I provide pathways to completion.

1.  **The Blueprint (Free on GitHub):** Every repo here is a detailed strategic plan‚Äîthe "why," the architecture, and the challenges. The MVP and foundational `README` are always free. The knowledge is free. Use it to build it yourself.
2.  **The Roadmap (Paid Version):** If you want to get there faster, the paid version of the repo provides the full roadmap, advanced documentation, and premium code assets to accelerate your build.
3.  **The Assets (√Ä La Carte on Cults3D):** For projects with physical components, you can buy the 3D models directly. No subscription required.
4.  **The Partnership (Direct Commission):** If you want a collaborator to get your project across the finish line, I'm available for hire.

### **Core Philosophy: The Mavric Way** üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Permission is a Myth:** You already have it. Stop waiting and start building.
-   **Ship at 80%:** "Perfect" is the imaginary friend of "never shipped." The last 20% is where the real learning happens anyway.
-   **The Code is the Proof:** Credentials don't matter. Working systems do.
-   **Trust the Itch:** Intuition is just fast-twitch thinking. Your gut knows things market research doesn't.
-   **Brutal Honesty:** Markets are honest. Your code should be too. If it's complex, it's wrong.

### **üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack (Whatever Works)**

-   **Languages**: Python for speed, Rust when that's not fast enough, JavaScript for the pretty parts, C++ for hardware whispers.
-   **Data**: PostgreSQL for serious relationships, Redis for speed, SQLite for prototypes that might grow up.
-   **Infrastructure**: Strong, flexible, and never married to one expensive brand.

### **ü§ù Let's Collaborate**

A good pull request is the best way to say "hello," but here are other ways to engage:

-   **Fork a Blueprint**: Build it, break it, make it better.
-   **Become a Partner**: Shared risk, shared reward on a new venture.
-   **Hire Me**: You bring the problem; I'll bring the keyboard.

*(**A Note on Boundaries**: If you wanna pick my brain, that's what a consulting gig is for. Ideas are cheap; execution is everything.)*

### **Patreon Update:**

The Patreon is currently in development. We're building out our MVPs and will launch with the first full roadmap soon.

### **Ready to build?** Drop me a line or just fork something and make it awesome. üöÄ
