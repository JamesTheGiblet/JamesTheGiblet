🧠 James The Giblet | Mythic Builder Portal

MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL

Welcome to the modular vault of James The Giblet — polymath, caretaker, and mythwright. This GitHub portal serves as a living archive of my robotic artifacts, AI-powered systems, and ritualized engineering practices. Here, each repository is a scroll, a living codex, or a project guide.

🔮 The Invocation

This portal is a retro-terminal themed sigil, blending my creative works with a cohesive brand identity:

    Advanced AI, robotics & 3D fabrication glyphs.

    A living codex of mythic engineering rituals, embodied in each project's README.

    Lore scrolls & prophetic design archives.

    CLI-style UI with glyph logic and hidden panels.

🛠️ The Ritual Stack

The site's architecture is built upon a foundation of powerful glyphs:

    HTML/CSS (CRT + neon styling)

    Three.js for the 3D artifact viewer.

    GitHub API for the repository browser.

    QR logic for linking to physical artifacts.

    ESP32 + Pi integrations (hardware modules).

    OpenAI TTS for Joshua voice synthesis.

🧙 Featured Artifacts

    🧬 Praxis: The Living Codex: An experimental, self-evolving AI presence designed with a bio-driven backend.

    🤖 Project G.I.S.M.O.: A mobile robot showcasing Python-based robotics, dead reckoning, and adaptive navigation.

    🛠️ TotalControl: An AI-powered GCode invocation engine for precision 3D fabrication.

    📝 EmbedID: A cryptographic tool to embed ownership sigils into source code, verifying creative lineage.

    🎨 Random-Art: A Python-powered exploration of generative art, creating unique, algorithmically driven designs.

📜 The Ritual of Creation: Free vs. Commissioned Transmissions

This portal provides detailed README transmissions for free, offering a guide for builders to attempt to recreate these projects. These scrolls are a starting point for your own ritual.

    Full Documented Roadmap: For a 95% success rate based on leveraging AI assistance and a basic understanding of file structure and code, you can purchase my roadmap and a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough from concept to MVP on jamesthegiblet.co.uk.

    Commissioned Transmissions: I am also open to creating custom roadmaps and READMEs for other builders' projects. Contact me through my website to discuss your unique needs.

📦 Artifacts for Purchase

The physical artifacts of my work are also available. You can find my 3D models for sale on Cults3D under the current sigil "Shapemaker," though I plan to rebrand this to "J.T.G." to maintain the brand's consistency.

📜 License Codex & Authorship

All content is the ritualized work of James The Giblet. Modular sovereignty and ritual authorship are protected via EmbedID logic.

    “Modularity is Mythos. Build. Ritual. Repeat.”
