## 🚀 My Mission: Building the Tools for Digital Sovereignty

I believe in building technology that empowers individuals. My work focuses on creating tools and systems that are private-by-design, user-owned, and built to last. Below is a selection of projects that serve as tangible evidence of this philosophy.

## 🧰 Featured Projects & Research

### 🛡️ **PROJECT: Aegis-CLI — Automated Security Documentation**
***A command-line tool that transforms a multi-week compliance task into a 3-second automated process.***

* **Problem:** System Security Plans are a high-cost, high-friction, and often-neglected compliance requirement, exposing projects to risk.
* **Solution:** A Go-based CLI that recursively scans a codebase and auto-generates over 95% of the required security documentation instantly.
* **Outcome:** Compresses a 2-4 week manual process into a 3-second task, eliminating cost and enabling universal adoption of security best practices.
* **Skills:** `Go (Golang)` `CLI Development` `System Architecture` `Concurrency` `Security Compliance`

### 🧠 **PROJECT: DPMS — The Private AI Personality Blueprint**
***A privacy-first AI platform that models human personality, running entirely on a local machine with zero cloud dependencies.***

* **Problem:** Cloud-based AI tools force a trade-off between utility and privacy, requiring users to surrender sensitive personal data.
* **Solution:** A local-first AI platform using Ollama that provides deep personality insights without data ever leaving the user's machine.
* **Outcome:** Establishes a new paradigm for AI tools built on digital sovereignty, proving the viability of a privacy-centric, local-first model.
* **Skills:** `Python` `AI/ML` `Local LLM Integration` `NLP` `Privacy-by-Design Architecture` `Streamlit` `SQLite`

### 🤖 **PROJECT: Johnny 5 "Number 3" — Advanced Robotics Platform**
***An advanced, multi-brain robotics platform designed as a serious challenge for integrated engineering skills.***

* **Problem:** Most robotics kits are too simplistic for serious builders who want to master the integration of complex, multi-domain systems.
* **Solution:** A complete architectural blueprint for a modular, multi-brain robot, distributing tasks across multiple processors.
* **Outcome:** A tangible proof of cross-domain mastery in mechanical, electronic, and software engineering, and an extensible platform for advanced AI/robotics research.
* **Skills:** `Systems Integration` `Hardware Engineering` `Electronics` `Distributed Systems` `Power Management` `Technical Writing`
