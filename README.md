# Hey, I'm James

Maker who can't stop building things.

**Day job:** Carpenter, locksmith, water hygiene, asbestos control, PAT tester, fire warden, first aid... bunch of other trades.  
**Real job:** Whatever I'm obsessed with that week.

3D printing, robotics, games, dev tools, AI systems - if it gets stuck in my head, I build it. Usually fast. Recent example: published [an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightweight-env-validator) in 2 days because env validation was annoying me.

My mind runs at 100mph, so I repo everything in detailed READMEs. Some projects are finished. Some are waiting for me to circle back. All of them are documented well enough that future me (or you) can pick them up.

I live with dyslexia, depression, and anxiety. Was told I couldn't learn. Spent my life proving that wrong - one discipline at a time.

Some people see code as work. I see it as another workshop tool, just one I can use at 2am without making noise.

## 🧠 The Big Projects

### [Adaptive Intelligence Platform](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/adaptive-intelligence)
Started building AI-powered dev tools because the same problems kept breaking my workflow. Realized I was building an entire platform. Suite includes secret scanning (Whisper), security compliance (Aegis), code watermarking (EmbedID), and more. Four tools at MVP, more in development.  
`Python` `AI/ML` `Security` `DevTools`

### [Praximous AI Gateway](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/praximous_mvp_scaffold)
Secure, on-premise AI gateway for enterprises. Built because vendor lock-in and cloud dependencies are annoying. Dynamic failover, pluggable providers, reusable "Smart Skills." Your data never leaves your infrastructure.  
`Python` `FastAPI` `Docker` `AI Gateway` `Enterprise`

## 📦 Shipped & Working

### [lightweight-env-validator](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/lightweight-env-validator)
Env validation was annoying me. Built this in 2 days. 2KB, zero dependencies, does the job.  
`JavaScript` `Node.js` `npm`

### [Project Flux 2.0](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/project-flux)
Game where modding IS the game. Every line of code is hackable. Built it to prove software should be truly yours.  
`JavaScript` `Game Dev` `Modular Systems`

### [PinPoint Planner](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/pinpoint-planner)
Hardware project planner for Raspberry Pi/Arduino. Got tired of hunting through datasheets and frying pins.  
`JavaScript` `Hardware` `Raspberry Pi` `Arduino`

## 🔨 Built (MVPs / In Progress)

### [Praximous Design System Generator](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/praximous-design-system)
CSS design token generator. Made our brand consistent, then dogfooded it to style itself.  
`CSS` `Design Systems` `Web Tools`

### [Interactive README Generator](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/interactive-readme-generator-with-ai-pro)
Makes writing docs less painful. Privacy-first, runs in browser, no server needed.  
`JavaScript` `Documentation` `Privacy-First`

---

## 📋 Documented & Ready to Build

### [E.M.B.E.R. Robot](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/ember-robot)
Two-wheeled self-balancing robot. Classic control systems challenge. Documented in detail, will build when I cycle back.  
`C++` `Robotics` `Raspberry Pi` `PID Control`

## 💡 The Pattern

If you look at my repos, you'll notice:
- **Accessible tools** - I remember what it's like when things are needlessly hard
- **No gatekeeping** - Modular, open, hackable by design
- **Clear docs** - Because I had to learn everything the hard way
- **Fast execution** - When I'm locked in, I ship quickly
- **Ideas for later** - Lots of repos are just detailed plans for when the obsession circles back

*Built in the margins: 1.5 hours before work, 7 hours after. If something's needlessly complicated or gatekept, I'll probably take a swing at it.*
