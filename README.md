# Hey, I'm James

Maker who can't stop building things.

**Day job:** Facilities caretaker at Pharmagenesis  
**Real job:** Whatever I'm obsessed with that week

3D printing, robotics, simulations, dev tools, AI systems - if it gets stuck in my head, I build it. Usually fast.

I live with dyslexia, depression, and anxiety. Was told I couldn't learn. Spent my life proving that wrong - one discipline at a time.

My mind runs at 100mph, so I document everything in detailed READMEs. Some projects are finished. Some are waiting for me to circle back. All of them are built in the margins: 1.5 hours before work, 7 hours after.

30-year dental decay simulator. Built in 2h 16m. Shows exactly when teeth need attention.  
`HTML` `JavaScript` `Exponential Decay` `Healthcare`

### [DopeDecay](https://jamesthegiblet.github.io/dope-forge/)

## 🧬 Forge Theory: My 8-Year Framework

**The core idea:** Emergence and decay follow predictable patterns across every domain - from cells to code to motivation.

I've spent 8 years validating this through **three distinct applications:**

### 1️⃣ Emergence Simulations (35+ demos)
Watch complex systems emerge from simple rules:
- [MoneyForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/moneyforge) - Economic systems from barter
- [LinguaForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/langforge) - Language evolution (57KB peer-review-ready)
- [LifeForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/lifeforge) - Cellular development
- [Primordial](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/artforge) - Evolutionary art engine
- [35+ more simulations](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/forge_theory) demonstrating universal patterns

### 2️⃣ Decay Engine (21 commercial tools)
Same math, different industries. Exponential decay modeling for:
- **Healthcare:** ToothForge, DopeDecay
- **Automotive:** [TyreForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/tyre-forge) (tread wear prediction)
- **Pharma:** [TrialForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/trial-forge) (patient retention)
- **Industrial:** [ServoForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/servo-forge) (predictive maintenance)
- **Cybersecurity:** [CyberForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/cyber-forge) (breach probability)
- **Finance:** [FireForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/fire-forge) (FIRE retirement calculator)
- **Sales:** [LeadForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/lead_leakage_forge) (conversion decay)
- **Sustainability:** [CarbonForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/carbon-forge) + [EmissionsForge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/emissions-forge)
- **Plus:** ScopeGuard, CaffeineForge, Motor-Forge, Supply-Forge, O-Licence Guard, and more

### 3️⃣ Hardware Validation (Physical proof)
The robots that prove emergence works in atoms, not just bits:
- [Project Jumbo](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/project_jumbo) - 8-year robot evolution, 100+ generations, emergent language
- [EMBER](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/Project-E.M.B.E.R) - Self-balancing robot with phototropic behavior
- [Johnny 5](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/Praximous-Johnny-5-Codex) - Advanced multi-brain robotics platform
- [G.I.S.M.O.](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/Project-G.I.S.M.O) - Autonomous wanderer
- [Golem-Forge](https://github.com/jamesthegiblet/Golem-Forge) - 1.2m³ 3D printer

## 💡 The Pattern

If you look at my repos, you'll notice:

- **Fast execution** - ToothForge: 2h 16m. DopeDecay: same day. lightweight-env-validator: 2 days
- **Cross-domain thinking** - Same framework works for teeth, tyres, motivation, and robots
- **Accessible by design** - No gatekeeping, clear docs, modular architecture
- **Build what matters** - If something's needlessly complicated, I'll take a swing at it
- **Document everything** - Because I had to learn the hard way

## 🌟 Featured Research

### Project Jumbo ⭐
**8-year magnum opus.** Physical robots that evolved through 100+ generations, developed emergent language (28 unique signals), and showed personality divergence from identical code. This is PhD-level work without the paperwork.

### Primordial ⭐
Evolutionary art engine using genetic algorithms and multi-objective optimization. Watch beauty emerge from mathematical selection pressure.

### MoneyForge ⭐
Models the emergence of money from barter economies. Demonstrates how collective fiction (currency) emerges from practical need. Philosophical depth meets executable simulation.
