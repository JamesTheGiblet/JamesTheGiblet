# üß† James The Giblet | Mythic Builder Portal

**MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL**

Welcome to the modular vault of James The Giblet ‚Äî polymath, caretaker, and mythwright. This GitHub portal serves as a living archive of my robotic artifacts, AI-powered systems, and ritualized engineering practices. Here, each repository is a scroll, a living codex, or a project guide.

### üîÆ The Invocation

This portal is a retro-terminal themed sigil, blending my creative works with a cohesive brand identity:

  * Advanced AI, robotics & 3D fabrication glyphs.
  * A living codex of mythic engineering rituals, embodied in each project's README.
  * Lore scrolls & prophetic design archives.
  * CLI-style UI with glyph logic and hidden panels.

-----

### üõ†Ô∏è The Ritual Stack

The site's architecture is built upon a foundation of powerful glyphs:

  * **HTML/CSS** (CRT + neon styling)
  * **Three.js** for the 3D artifact viewer.
  * **GitHub API** for the repository browser.
  * **QR logic** for linking to physical artifacts.
  * **ESP32 + Pi integrations** (hardware modules).
  * **OpenAI TTS** for Joshua voice synthesis.

### üßô Featured Artifacts

  * üß¨ **Praxis: The Living Codex**: An experimental, self-evolving AI presence designed with a bio-driven backend.
  * ü§ñ **Project G.I.S.M.O.**: A mobile robot showcasing Python-based robotics, dead reckoning, and adaptive navigation.
  * üõ†Ô∏è **TotalControl**: An AI-powered GCode invocation engine for precision 3D fabrication.
  * üìù **EmbedID**: A cryptographic tool to embed ownership sigils into source code, verifying creative lineage.
  * üé® **Random-Art**: A Python-powered exploration of generative art, creating unique, algorithmically driven designs.

# üìú The Ritual of Creation: Free vs. Commissioned Transmissions

This portal provides detailed README transmissions for free, offering a guide for builders to attempt to recreate these projects. These scrolls are a starting point for your own ritual.

For a **95% success rate** based on leveraging AI assistance and a basic understanding of file structure and code, you can purchase my roadmap and a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough from concept to MVP on my website:

I am also open to creating custom roadmaps and READMEs for other builders' projects. Contact me through my website to discuss your unique needs.

### üì¶ Artifacts for Purchase

The physical artifacts of my work are also available. You can find my 3D models for sale on **Cults3D** under the current sigil "Shapemaker," though I plan to rebrand this to "J.T.G." to maintain the brand's consistency.
