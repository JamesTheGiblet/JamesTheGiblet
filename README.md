# üåÄ The Mythic Builder Portal // WordPress Installation Codex

MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL

This codex outlines the technical ritual for constructing the Mythic Builder Portal on jamesthegiblet.co.uk. It serves as the definitive guide to deploying a scalable e-commerce platform that aligns with the Praximous Business Plan, fusing the mythic engineering brand with a robust, community-driven storefront.
üß¨ Overview & Core Glyph

The Mythic Builder Portal is a dynamic, living archive built on the WordPress content management system. Unlike a static page, this platform uses WooCommerce to manage the full array of your offerings, from physical "Mythic Artifacts" to digital "Codex Fragments" and a premium subscription service. The aesthetic is defined by a custom-built theme that translates the retro-terminal, mythic brand into a functional and navigable portal.
üåü Key Invocations

This platform is engineered to support the full ritual of your business plan:

    Mythic Artifacts: A premium product gallery for displaying high-quality, pre-assembled 3D prints with a premium price model.

    Ritual Kits: A hybrid product system for selling bundles of STL files, printed guides, and physical hardware components.

    Codex Fragments: An automated digital fulfillment system for delivering individual STL files and PDF build guides immediately upon purchase.

    PraximOS Subscription Portal: A private, password-protected area of the site for premium subscribers, granting them access to exclusive lore and challenges.

    Community Pantheon: A blog or forum for hosting "Ritual Logs" and project updates, fostering a community of builders.

‚öôÔ∏è The Ritual Stack

The architectural sigil for this portal is:

    Codebase: Visual Studio Code

    Hosting: GitHub Pages

    Domain: GoDaddy

    Fulfillment & Payment: Managed by external platforms (e.g., Cults3D, Gumroad) via direct links and embeds.

    Branding & UI: A custom-coded static website based on the Praximous Brand Codex (HTML/CSS/JS).

üõ†Ô∏è The Initiation Ritual

To awaken the Mythic Builder Portal, perform these steps:

    Code the Portal: Create the website files (index.html, style.css, app.js) using Visual Studio Code.

    Invoke the Repository: Push your code to a public repository on GitHub.

    Deploy the Hosting: Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings to serve your website from the main branch.

    Transmute the Domain: In your GoDaddy account, configure the DNS settings to point your custom domain (jamesthegiblet.co.uk) to your new GitHub Pages site.

    Create Your Products: Upload your "Mythic Artifacts" and "Codex Fragments" to your chosen e-commerce platforms (e.g., Cults3D, Gumroad).

    Link the Artifacts: Update the product links on your website to direct visitors to your product pages on those external platforms.

    Begin the Ritual: The portal is now ready to receive invocations and process orders.

üìú Path of Evolution

The evolution of the portal will be continuous:

    Ritual Logs: The creation of a blog to publish regular content marketing.

    Community Integration: The creation of a dedicated Discord server for premium subscribers.

    SEO Auguries: Ongoing optimization for keywords related to your projects and brand.
