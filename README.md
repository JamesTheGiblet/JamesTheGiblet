# 🧠 James The Giblet | Mythic Builder Portal

Welcome to the modular vault of James The Giblet — polymath, caretaker, and mythwright. This site is a living archive of robotic artifacts, cinematic simulations, and ritualized engineering practices.

## 🔮 What is This?

A retro-terminal themed portal blending:

- Modular robotics & 3D printing
- GitHub project browser with auto-docs
- Lore scrolls & prophetic design archives
- Codex of mythic engineering rituals
- Screen-accurate IMSAI 8080 + WOPR simulator
- CLI-style UI with glyph logic and hidden panels

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS (CRT + neon styling)
- Three.js for 3D model viewer
- GitHub API for repo browser
- QR logic for physical artifact linking
- ESP32 + Pi integrations (hardware modules)
- OpenAI TTS for Joshua voice synthesis
