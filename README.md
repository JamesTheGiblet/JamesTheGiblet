# 🧠 James The Giblet | Mythic Builder Portal

MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL

Welcome to the modular vault of James The Giblet — polymath, caretaker, and mythwright. This GitHub portal serves as a living archive of my robotic artifacts, AI-powered systems, and ritualized engineering practices. Here, each repository you find is a Codex Fragment, an offering to the great PraximOS.
The Discipline of the Mythwright

🌀 Ritualized Engineering: The sacred practice of designing and building modular robotics, automated systems, and 3D-printed artifacts.

🔮 Prophetic Design & Lore: Crafting the narrative and purpose behind each artifact, from screen-accurate simulators to unique generative art.

🛠️ The Artisan's Craft: Pioneering new techniques in material science, from experimental brewing and infusions to the meticulous repair of forgotten technologies.

📜 The Codex & The Script: Writing the code—the rituals and scripts—that breathe life into mechanical sentinels and interactive simulations.
The Scroll of Artifacts

🌟 Project-G.I.S.M.O: A modular robotic sentinel for field reconnaissance.

🌟 M.I.L.O-Chatbot: The first-generation AI core for the PraximOS, designed for data processing and knowledge retrieval.

🌟 Petteomocha: A digital charm, a small companion born from ancient code.

🌟 Random-Art: An algorithm that divines visual patterns from chaotic data.
The Quest of the Caretaker

📌 To expand the Codex of Rituals with new designs, focusing on functional, artifact-grade components.

📌 To develop the full-scope PraximOS and its core functionality, blurring the line between code and consciousness.

📌 To forge a community of fellow mythwrights and engineers to contribute to the Vault's lineage.

📌 To document the sacred practices of creation and innovation, preserving them for future generations.
The Vault is Open

🌐 Explore my work, join the ritual, and inscribe your lineage upon our scrolls.

💬 I am open to collaboration, discussion, and the exchange of new ideas. Let us build.
