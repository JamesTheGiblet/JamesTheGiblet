# James Mavric: I Make Stuff.

> Some people play games. Some people read books. I am a maker. It's not what I do; it's who I am.

> I dream of code, robots, and ideas. I wake up and build them. This workshop is the public record of that compulsion. The projects here are born from necessity and curiosity—they are the tools I needed, the problems I found interesting, and the things that simply demanded to be built.

### My Compass: The Workshop Philosophy 🛠️

This is the code I operate by.

-   **Curiosity is the Spec Sheet:** An itch, an annoyance, a "what if"—that's where every project begins. Intuition is just pattern recognition at speed. I trust it completely.
-   **Utility First, Commerce Second:** I build tools to solve my own problems. That's the test. That's the validation. If a solution is good enough to become essential to my daily workflow, it's good enough to become a product. That's the business.
-   **Build in Public, Typos and All:** The process is as important as the product. I share my work early and often. "Perfect" is the enemy of "done."
-   **The Code is the Proof:** Credentials and talk are cheap. Working systems are the only things that matter.

### How This Workshop Operates: From Itch to Tool

My work follows a natural lifecycle. The business model is a reflection of that process, not the other way around.

1.  **The Itch (An Idea):** It all starts with a problem I want to solve for myself.
2.  **The Blueprint (Open-Source on GitHub):** The core solution is always built in public and shared for free. The knowledge is non-negotiable. Fork it, learn from it, build on it.
3.  **The Polished Tool (Commercial):** If a blueprint proves exceptionally useful, it may graduate into a professional-grade tool for those who need a reliable, fully-supported product that just works.
4.  **Direct Collaboration (Consulting):** For when your problem is interesting enough to become my problem. I'm available for select consulting engagements.

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack (Whatever Solves the Problem)

-   **Languages**: Python for speed of thought, Rust for speed of execution, JavaScript for the pretty parts, C++ for hardware whispers.
-   **Data**: PostgreSQL for serious relationships, Redis for fleeting ones, SQLite for prototypes that might grow up.

### 🤝 Get Involved

-   **The best way to say "hello" is a good pull request.**
-   **For a deeper collaboration** or if your project requires dedicated expertise, let's talk about a consulting gig.
-   **For everything else,** explore the repos and see what problem we can solve next.
