# 🧠 The Friendly Mavric's Manifesto

> **James "The Giblet"** — Your friendly neighborhood builder who codes first, asks permission never.

I build robots, trading bots, and other fun stuff based on gut feelings and caffeine. I only write docs when I absolutely have to, and I ship code that's about 80% ready, because the last 20% is where the real learning happens.

## 🚀 What I'm Building Right Now

- **Trading Bots**: Digital critters that munch on market volatility (mostly house-trained)
- **Autonomous Robots**: Hardware + intuition + maybe some hot glue
- **Modular Systems**: Built like Legos, not house of cards
- **Dev Tools**: So good they do the work while you nap

*Check out my [pinned repos](#) for the latest experiments.*

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Credentials? Nah. Gatekeeping? Hard pass. Permission? You already have it.**

- Build cool things that work. Ship things that help someone. The code is the proof.
- Ritual is for cults. Let's just focus on making an impact.
- Getting stuck is just your brain telling you to go for a walk.
- My GitHub is my resume, typos and all.
- Intuition is just fast-twitch thinking. Trust it.

### Extended Beliefs

- The best docs are a running app that solves a real-world headache
- If your code is so complex you feel smart writing it, you're doing it wrong
- If you can't explain your idea in a tweet, it's not ready yet
- Markets are brutally honest. Your code should be too
- "Perfect" is the imaginary friend of "never shipped"

## ⚡ The 'Get It Done' Method

1. **Sense the Itch**: Trust your gut. It knows things the market research deck doesn't
2. **Build the Heart**: Slap together the core feature. Make it do the one thing that matters most
3. **Give It Legs**: Break the system into Lego-like pieces so it can evolve
4. **Show Your Work**: Provide just enough proof so others can see it's not magic
5. **Let It Go**: Move on to the next shiny thing (or double down if this one is really fun)

### Decision Framework

- **The "So What?" Test**: Does this actually fix a real problem for a real human?
- **The Weekend Test**: Can I duct-tape a version of this together by Monday morning?
- **The Dust Test**: Will anyone still care about this in six months?
- **The "Get It" Gate**: Can a friend understand the point in 10 minutes?
- **The Lego Check**: Does it play nicely with other systems?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python for speed, Rust when speed isn't fast enough, JavaScript for pretty, C++ for hardware whispers. But honestly, whatever works.

**Infrastructure**: Strong, flexible, not married to one expensive brand.

**Data**: PostgreSQL for serious relationships, Redis for speed, SQLite for prototypes that might grow up.

## 🤝 Let's Build Something Together

### Ways to Engage

- **🔨 Consulting**: You bring the problem, I bring the keyboard
- **🤝 Collaboration**: Partners in crime. Shared risk, shared reward
- **🎓 Mentorship**: Building something real and stuck? Show me what you've got
- **💼 Hiring**: Your GitHub is your resume

### Friendly Boundaries

- Happy to chat, but "picking my brain" sounds like a zombie attack. Let's make it a proper gig for deep dives
- Equity for ideas? Show me working code, then we'll talk
- NDAs? Execution is everything. Let's just build

## 📊 Success Metrics (What Actually Matters)

✅ Problems we actually solved  
✅ Systems that run without babysitters  
✅ Code useful enough for others to steal  
✅ Time saved, for you and others  
✅ Money made (or saved) is a nice bonus  

❌ GitHub stars (landlord doesn't accept them)  
❌ Lines of code (we're not building a text factory)  
❌ Twitter framework arguments

## 🎪 Welcome Aboard, Builder!

If you're here to tinker, build, or peek under the hood—awesome. If you're waiting for someone to assign you a task, you're in the wrong place. This is "choose your own adventure" territory.

**How We Roll:**
- Build with your gut, then let feedback make it better
- A good pull request is the best way to say "hello"
- No gatekeeping. The door's wide open
- Working code > theoretical debates

**Ready to build?** Drop me a line or just fork something and make it awesome.
