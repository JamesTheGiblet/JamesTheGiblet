Proprietor: James The Giblet

1. Executive Summary

Mission Statement: To fuse modular robotics, mythic lore, and open-source collaboration, empowering a community of builders to create, share, and expand a universe of ritualized engineering.

Business Objective: To establish "James The Giblet | Mythic Builder Portal" as the premier destination for narrative-driven modular robotics, 3D printing artifacts, and engineering education, generating sustainable revenue through direct product sales, premium content subscriptions, and a vibrant contributor-based ecosystem.

Keys to Success:

    Strong Brand Identity: The unique "retro-terminal, mythic engineering" aesthetic is the core differentiator.

    Narrative-Driven Product Line: Products are not just STL files; they are "artifacts" and "codex fragments" with their own lore.

    Community Engagement: Fostering an active community through the .rituals/ folder and hack.html page to drive organic growth and content creation.

    Scalable E-Commerce Platform: Utilizing WordPress and WooCommerce to manage diverse product types (digital and physical) efficiently.

2. Company Description

Legal Structure: Sole Proprietorship (or other chosen legal entity).

Business Model: Hybrid e-commerce and subscription-based content platform. The business will operate primarily online, with all sales and community interaction handled through the website.

Value Proposition:
The "Mythic Builder Portal" offers a solution to the generic, uninspired nature of most maker communities and 3D printing storefronts. We provide a fully realized universe for creators who are passionate about narrative, aesthetic, and the ritual of building.
